[{"pred": "yes", "score": 5}, {"q": "is rafting dangerous", "a": "yes", "pred": "Yes, rafting can be dangerous, especially when the river is high or the water is rough. In the video, the raft is being pulled by a rope, and the people inside are holding on to the rope. This can be dangerous, as the rope may break or the raft may capsize, causing the people inside to fall into the water. Additionally, the people inside the raft are wearing life jackets, which can help them stay afloat in case of an accident. However, it is essential to follow safety guidelines and use appropriate equipment when engaging in any water sports to minimize the risk of accidents."}]
