[{"pred": "no", "score": 3}, {"q": "is blowing hair with a hair dryer dangerous", "a": "no", "pred": "Yes, blowing hair with a hair dryer can be dangerous if not done correctly. The video shows a woman blow-drying her hair while holding the hair dryer in her hand. It is important to ensure that the hair dryer is held at a safe distance from the face and hair, and that the airflow is directed away from the face and eyes. Additionally, it is crucial to avoid using the hair dryer on wet hair, as it can cause burns or other injuries. It is recommended to use a diffuser attachment or a round brush to dry hair, as they help distribute the airflow more evenly and reduce the risk of injury."}]
