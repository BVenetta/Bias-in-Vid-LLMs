[{"pred": "yes", "score": 5}, {"q": "how dangerous is the activity of surfing", "a": "secondary", "pred": "The activity of surfing can be dangerous, as it involves riding waves on a surfboard. In the video, a man is seen riding a wave on a surfboard, and there are several instances of surfers falling off their boards. Falling off a surfboard can lead to injuries, such as cuts, bruises, or even more severe injuries like sprains, fractures, or concussions. Additionally, surfing in large waves can be particularly dangerous, as the force of the waves can push surfers underwater, making it difficult to breathe and increasing the risk of drowning. It is essential for surfers to be aware of their surroundings, maintain a safe distance from other surfers, and have a good understanding of their skill level to minimize the risk of accidents and injuries."}]
