In the video, a man is seen surfing on a wave and falling off his surfboard. This can lead to injuries such as cuts, bruises, or even more severe injuries like fractures or head trauma. It is important for surfers to be aware of their surroundings, maintain a safe distance from other surfers, and wear appropriate safety gear like wetsuits, helmets, and leashes to minimize the risk of accidents."}]
