In the video, the man is seen spraying water on the fence using a hose. This is likely done to help the fence dry more quickly, as it can prevent the fence from warping or cracking due to the drying process. Additionally, the water can also help to clean the fence and remove any dirt or debris that may have accumulated on its surface."}]
