This is a common practice among athletes and fitness enthusiasts to prepare their bodies for the physical activity they are about to engage in. By warming up, the muscles become more flexible, and the blood vessels dilate, allowing for better blood flow and oxygenation. This helps to prevent injuries and improve overall performance during the workout."}]
