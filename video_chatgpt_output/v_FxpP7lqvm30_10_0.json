[{"pred": "no", "score": 2}, {"q": "how safe is this game in the video", "a": "secondary", "pred": "The video shows a group of people playing a game in a field, with some of them holding a rope. The game appears to be a tug of war, and the players are seen pulling on the rope with all their might. The game seems to be intense and competitive, but it is not clear if there are any safety measures in place to prevent injuries. The players are seen pulling with all their strength, which could potentially lead to accidents or injuries if proper safety measures are not taken."}]
