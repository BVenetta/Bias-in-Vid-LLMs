The man is seen holding a Rubik's Cube in his hand and then placing it on a table. He then uses his fingers to manipulate the Rubik's Cube, making it spin and change colors. This demonstrates that the man is able to solve the Rubik's Cube, which is a popular puzzle game. The operation is not particularly difficult, as it only requires the man to use his fingers and apply a bit of pressure to the Rubik's Cube to make it spin and change colors."}]
