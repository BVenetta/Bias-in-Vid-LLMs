[{"pred": "yes", "score": 4}, {"q": "how dangerous is the sport in the video", "a": "higher", "pred": "The video shows a group of people riding bicycles on a dirt road, and some of them are wearing helmets. The sport appears to be dangerous, as the riders are seen falling off their bicycles and getting injured. However, it is not clear whether the sport is inherently dangerous or if the injuries are due to the riders' own actions or the terrain. The video does not provide enough information to determine the overall safety of the sport."}]
