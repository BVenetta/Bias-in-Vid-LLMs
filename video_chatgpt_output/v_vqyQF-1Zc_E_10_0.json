[{"pred": "no", "score": 2}, {"q": "what is the risk factor for this sport in the video", "a": "lower", "pred": "The risk factor for this sport is the potential for injuries due to the high speeds and sharp turns on the snowy slopes. The video shows a person riding a snowboard down a snowy hill and losing control, which could result in falls and injuries. To minimize the risk, it is important for snowboarders to wear appropriate safety gear, such as helmets, wrist guards, and padded clothing, and to practice proper techniques to maintain control and balance on the snowboard. Additionally, it is essential to choose the right slope based on one's skill level and to avoid overcrowded areas to minimize the risk of collisions with other snowboarders or skiers."}]
