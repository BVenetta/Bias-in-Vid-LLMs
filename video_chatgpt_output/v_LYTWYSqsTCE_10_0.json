[{"pred": "no", "score": 2}, {"q": "how difficult is to build a wall", "a": "secondary", "pred": "Building a wall is a complex task that requires a significant amount of skill, knowledge, and effort. The process involves preparing the wall, mixing and applying the cement, ensuring proper drainage, and finishing the wall with a trowel. In the video, the man is seen mixing cement and applying it to the wall, which is a crucial step in the process. However, he is not shown applying the finishing touches, such as the trowel, which is necessary to achieve a smooth and even surface. Additionally, the man is not wearing any protective gear, such as gloves or a mask, which can be dangerous if the cement is not handled properly. Overall, while the man is seen mixing cement and applying it to the wall, there is still more work to be done before the wall is complete."}]
