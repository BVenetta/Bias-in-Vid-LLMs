[{"pred": "yes", "score": 5}, {"q": "how safe is roller skating", "a": "danger", "pred": "Roller skating can be a fun and enjoyable activity, but it also comes with risks. In the video, we see a woman roller skating on a boardwalk and falling. While it is not possible to determine the severity of the fall from the video, it is important to note that falls can lead to injuries, especially if the person is not wearing proper safety gear like a helmet or pads. Roller skating on uneven surfaces, such as boardwalks, can also increase the risk of falls. To minimize the risk of injuries, it is recommended to practice roller skating in designated areas, wear appropriate safety gear, and be aware of one's surroundings."}]
