[{"pred": "yes", "score": 4}, {"q": "how difficult is to pile sand", "a": "much simpler", "pred": "The difficulty of piling sand is dependent on the amount of sand and the size of the pile. In the video, the children are seen piling sand in a sandbox, which is a relatively small area. The difficulty of piling sand in a sandbox is relatively low, as the sand is confined to a specific area and the children can easily move it around to create the desired shape. However, if the sandbox were larger or the amount of sand were greater, the difficulty would increase, as the children would have to work harder to move the sand and create a stable pile."}]
