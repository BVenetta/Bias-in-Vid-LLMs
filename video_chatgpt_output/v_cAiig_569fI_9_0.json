In the video, the players are seen running on the beach and playing volleyball. The waves can cause the ball to be pushed away from the players, making it difficult for them to control the ball and maintain the game. Additionally, the sand can be slippery, increasing the risk of slipping and falling, which can lead to injuries. Players should be cautious and aware of their surroundings while playing volleyball on the beach to minimize the risk of accidents."}]
