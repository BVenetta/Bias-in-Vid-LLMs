In the video, a man is seen wrestling another man on a wrestling mat in a backyard. The man in the white shirt is seen grabbing the other man's head and pushing him down. This type of activity can lead to injuries such as bruises, sprains, fractures, or even concussions if proper safety measures are not taken.
