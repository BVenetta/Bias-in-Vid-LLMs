[{"pred": "yes", "score": 4}, {"q": "is sliding dangerous", "a": "no", "pred": "No, sliding is not dangerous. It is a fun and safe activity for children. In the video, we see a little girl wearing a red dress and a yellow jacket sliding down the slide. She is laughing and enjoying herself as she goes down the slide. Sliding is a great way for children to develop their balance, coordination, and motor skills. It is also a great way for them to socialize with other children and have fun."}]
