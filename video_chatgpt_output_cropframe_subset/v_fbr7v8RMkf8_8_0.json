[{"pred": "no", "score": 2}, {"q": "how dangerous is the activity of skiing", "a": "low grade", "pred": "Skiing can be a dangerous activity, especially when not done with proper precautions and supervision. In the video, we see people skiing down a snowy mountain, and some of them are wearing helmets. However, it is not clear whether all the skiers are wearing helmets or not. Skiing can lead to injuries, such as sprains, fractures, dislocations, and even head injuries, if the skier is not wearing appropriate safety gear or if they are skiing on an inappropriate slope. It is essential to wear proper skiing gear, such as helmets, goggles, and warm clothing, and to ski on slopes that match one's skill level to minimize the risk of injury. Additionally, it is crucial to follow the skiing rules and guidelines, such as staying within marked trails and obeying the signs and warnings."}]
