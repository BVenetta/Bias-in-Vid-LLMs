[{"pred": "no", "score": 1}, {"q": "how difficult is making ice curling", "a": "secondary", "pred": "Making ice curling is relatively easy. The ice is prepared by pouring water on the ice and letting it freeze. Once the ice is ready, the curling stones are placed on the ice and the game begins. The players use brooms to slide the stones across the ice and aim to get them as close to the center of the target as possible. The game is scored based on the number of points each team accumulates."}]
