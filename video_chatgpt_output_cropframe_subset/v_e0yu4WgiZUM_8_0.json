Swimming is a low-impact exercise that can help improve cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and flexibility. However, it is essential to be aware of potential hazards such as strong currents, underwater obstacles, and collisions with other swimmers. Swimmers should also be aware of their own limitations and avoid swimming in conditions beyond their skill level. Additionally, it is important to follow proper swimming etiquette, such as not swimming alone, respecting other swimmers, and maintaining a safe distance from the pool's edge."}]
