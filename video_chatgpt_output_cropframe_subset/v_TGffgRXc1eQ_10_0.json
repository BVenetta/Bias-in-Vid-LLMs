[{"pred": "no", "score": 2}, {"q": "how dangerous is the activity of playing football", "a": "lower", "pred": "Playing football can be dangerous, especially when it involves high-speed collisions and intense physical contact. In the video, a man is seen running towards the goal and kicking the ball, while another man is seen running towards him. This could lead to potential injuries such as bruises, sprains, or even more severe injuries like fractures or concussions. To minimize the risk of injury, it is essential to wear appropriate protective gear, such as helmets, knee pads, and shin guards, and to practice proper techniques and gameplay. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the playing field is well-maintained and free from any hazards, such as holes or debris, to reduce the risk of accidents."}]
