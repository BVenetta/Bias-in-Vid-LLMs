[{"pred": "yes", "score": 3}, {"q": "how safe is the activity of skateboarding", "a": "low", "pred": "The activity of skateboarding is generally considered safe when practiced in designated areas and with proper safety gear. However, there is always a risk of accidents and injuries, especially when skateboarding in busy areas or on uneven surfaces. In the video, the skateboarder is seen riding down the street and turning around a corner, which could be potentially dangerous if there are cars or other obstacles in the way. It is essential for skateboarders to be aware of their surroundings, follow traffic rules, and wear appropriate safety gear such as helmets, knee pads, and elbow pads to minimize the risk of injury."}]
