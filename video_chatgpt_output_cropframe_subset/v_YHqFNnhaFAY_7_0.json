[{"pred": "yes", "score": 5}, {"q": "how dangerous is this activity in the video", "a": "high", "pred": "The activity shown in the video is extremely dangerous and can lead to severe injuries or even fatalities. The man is riding a skateboard down a steep hill, which is a high-risk activity that requires a great deal of skill and experience. The skateboarder is wearing a helmet, which is a good safety measure, but it is not enough to protect him from the potential risks of the activity. The skateboarder is also wearing a backpack, which might be carrying additional weight that could affect his balance and control over the skateboard. The presence of a car in the video also indicates that the skateboarder is riding in a potentially hazardous environment, where there is a risk of collisions with vehicles. Overall, the activity shown in the video is extremely dangerous and should be avoided by anyone who is not experienced in skateboarding or riding down steep hills."}]
