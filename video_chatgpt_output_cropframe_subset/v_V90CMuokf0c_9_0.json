In the video, the man is paddling down the river, and the water appears to be flowing smoothly. The water's movement can be observed in the background, and the man's paddling can be seen as a result of the water's flow. Additionally, the presence of trees and the surrounding landscape can provide further context to the flow of the water. The video shows the man paddling down the river, which implies that the water is flowing in the right direction for him to navigate the river."}]
