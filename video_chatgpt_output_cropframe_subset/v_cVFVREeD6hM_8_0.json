They are using a manual push mower, which is not an efficient way to mow a large yard. The person is also wearing a black shirt and blue jeans, which are not suitable for outdoor work. They should wear appropriate clothing, such as a long-sleeved shirt and pants, to protect their skin from the sun and to keep them comfortable while working. Additionally, they should consider using a more efficient mower, such as a riding mower or a gas-powered push mower, to make the task easier and faster."}]
