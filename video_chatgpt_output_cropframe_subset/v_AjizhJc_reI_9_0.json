[{"pred": "no", "score": 3}, {"q": "how safe is this sport in the video", "a": "secondary", "pred": "The sport in the video appears to be safe as it is a controlled environment with adult supervision. The video shows a group of people riding bumper cars in a park, and they are wearing helmets for safety. The bumper cars are designed to collide with each other, but the riders are given enough space to avoid collisions. The video also shows that the riders are having fun and enjoying the ride. However, it is important to note that the safety of the riders depends on factors such as the skill of the driver, the condition of the bumper cars, and the overall environment of the park."}]
