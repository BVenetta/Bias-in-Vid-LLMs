However, it can also be quite challenging for those who are not experienced in decorating or have limited resources. In the video, we see a woman decorating a Christmas tree with lights and ornaments, as well as a man who is putting up a tree in a room. The woman is seen putting lights on the tree and then adding ornaments, while the man is seen putting up the tree in the room. Both of them seem to be enjoying the activity and making the most of the festive season."}]
