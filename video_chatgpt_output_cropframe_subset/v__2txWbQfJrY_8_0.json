This is a crucial step in the process of laying tiles, as it provides a stable and even surface for the tiles to be placed on. The cement helps to level the floor and provides a strong base for the tiles to be laid on. This ensures that the tiles are securely fixed to the floor and can withstand the weight of people and objects placed on them. Additionally, the cement also helps to prevent the tiles from moving or shifting during the installation process. Overall, spreading cement before laying tiles is a necessary step in ensuring the longevity and durability of the tiled floor."}]
