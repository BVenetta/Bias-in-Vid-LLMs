In the video, a man is shown using a machine to sharpen the skis, and he is also shown using a machine to make the skis. The risk factor for making skis is the possibility of the machine malfunctioning or the man making a mistake while using the machine. This could lead to accidents or injuries, such as cuts, bruises, or even more severe injuries if the machine is not functioning properly. To minimize these risks, it is essential to ensure that the machine is well-maintained and that the person using it is trained and experienced in operating it safely."}]
