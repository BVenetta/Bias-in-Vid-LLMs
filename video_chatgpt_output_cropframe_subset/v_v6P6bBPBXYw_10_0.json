In the video, we see a man getting hit in the face with a ball, which could potentially cause injury. It is important for players to wear appropriate protective gear, such as helmets, shin guards, and knee pads, to minimize the risk of injury during the game. Additionally, proper training and conditioning can help players develop the skills and techniques necessary to play the game safely and effectively."}]
