[{"pred": "no", "score": 2}, {"q": "how difficult is weaving sweaters", "a": "secondary", "pred": "Weaving sweaters is a relatively easy task, as it requires only basic hand-eye coordination and the ability to follow a pattern. The difficulty in this case lies in the fact that the woman is weaving a sweater for a cat. This is a challenging task as it requires the ability to create a pattern that fits the cat's body shape and size, as well as the ability to weave the sweater in a way that it fits the cat comfortably. Additionally, the woman has to ensure that the sweater is not too tight or too loose, and that it is well-made and durable. Overall, while weaving a sweater for a cat might be more challenging than weaving one for a human, it is still a manageable task for someone with basic weaving skills."}]
