[{"pred": "yes", "score": 4}, {"q": "how safe is this sport in the video", "a": "security", "pred": "The sport in the video is safe for the little girl as she is wearing a helmet and knee pads while playing. The helmet is essential for protecting her head from any potential injuries, and the knee pads help to cushion her knees in case of a fall. The girl is also playing in a store aisle, which is a relatively safe environment compared to playing on a hard surface like a road or a playground. However, it is important to note that the store aisle might not be as safe as a designated play area, and the girl should be supervised by an adult while playing."}]
