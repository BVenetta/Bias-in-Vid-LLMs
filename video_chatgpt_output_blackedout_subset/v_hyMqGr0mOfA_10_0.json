[{"pred": "no", "score": 2}, {"q": "what is the risk factor for throwing darts", "a": "lower", "pred": "The risk factor for throwing darts is the possibility of accidentally hitting someone or something, causing injury or damage. In the video, a man is seen throwing darts at a dartboard, and the darts are seen flying through the air. While the man is wearing a protective glove, there is still a risk of accidentally hitting someone or something, especially if the darts are thrown at a high speed or with poor aim. To minimize this risk, it is important to practice proper dart throwing techniques, use appropriate protective gear, and ensure that the dartboard is placed at a safe distance from people and objects."}]
