In the video, the person is seen running through the woods, and while it is not clear if they encounter any wild animals, they do come across a fallen tree and a rocky path. These obstacles can pose a risk to the runner's safety and well-being. To minimize the risk, the runner should be aware of their surroundings, maintain a safe distance from wild animals, and be prepared to navigate any obstacles in their path."}]
