[{"pred": "yes", "score": 5}, {"q": "how dangerous is the activity of skiing", "a": "much higher", "pred": "The activity of skiing can be dangerous, especially when attempting to ski down steep slopes or in challenging weather conditions. Skiers need to be aware of their surroundings, maintain control of their speed, and wear appropriate safety gear, such as helmets and goggles. Additionally, skiers should be aware of the terrain and snow conditions, as well as any potential hazards like ice patches, rocks, or tree wells. Skiing can also be dangerous if skiers are not familiar with the proper techniques or if they attempt to ski in areas beyond their skill level. It is important for skiers to practice and develop their skills gradually, and to always ski within their limits and the guidelines of the ski resort."}]
