[{"pred": "yes", "score": 4}, {"q": "how dangerous is the activity of surfing", "a": "secondary", "pred": "Surfing can be dangerous, especially for beginners. The activity involves riding on the face of a moving wave, which requires balance, strength, and agility. In the video, we see a man riding a wave on a surfboard, and he is able to maintain his balance and control. However, beginners may struggle to maintain balance and control, leading to falls and potential injuries. Additionally, the ocean can be unpredictable, with strong currents, sudden changes in wave patterns, and the presence of marine life such as sharks and jellyfish. Surfers should be aware of these risks and take necessary precautions, such as wearing appropriate safety gear, learning from experienced surfers, and staying within their skill level."}]
