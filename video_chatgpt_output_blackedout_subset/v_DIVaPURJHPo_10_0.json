[{"pred": "no", "score": 2}, {"q": "how dangerous is the activity of rope skipping", "a": "low", "pred": "The activity of rope skipping is not inherently dangerous, but it can pose risks if not practiced correctly or if the rope is not of good quality. In the video, a young girl is seen skipping rope in a dark room, and it appears that she is skipping with a rope that is not of good quality. This can lead to the rope breaking or becoming tangled, which can cause injuries to the girl or others nearby. To minimize the risk, it is important to practice skipping rope in a safe environment, use a high-quality rope, and ensure that the rope is not tangled or broken."}]
