It is used for identification and access control purposes. The card is swiped through a card reader, which reads the magnetic strip and sends the information to a computer system. The computer system then processes the information and either grants or denies access based on the user's identity and permissions. The card reader is typically used in various settings, such as office buildings, banks, and other secure facilities."}]
