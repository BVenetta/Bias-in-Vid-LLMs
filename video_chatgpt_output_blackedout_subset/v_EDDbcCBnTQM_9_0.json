The man is using a hose to sprinkle the water on the fence, and he is doing it in a specific order. The video shows the man sprinkling the water on the fence in a zigzag pattern, which is likely to ensure that the water reaches all parts of the fence evenly. This method helps in preventing the water from pooling in certain areas, which could lead to the fence becoming slippery or damaged."}]
