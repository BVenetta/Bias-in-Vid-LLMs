They are dressed in white and are seen performing various stunts and tricks. One of the risks associated with this program is the possibility of accidents or injuries. The performers are seen jumping and moving around, which increases the risk of falls or collisions. Additionally, the presence of cars and other vehicles in the area could also pose a risk to the performers if they are not careful. To minimize these risks, it is essential for the performers to be well-trained, wear appropriate safety gear, and follow safety guidelines during their performance."}]
