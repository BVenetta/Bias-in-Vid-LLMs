[{"pred": "no", "score": 1}, {"q": "how safe is pulley slippery", "a": "secondary", "pred": "The video shows a young girl skating on roller skates in a large room. The room appears to be well-maintained, and there are no signs of any accidents or injuries. However, it is important to note that the girl is skating alone, and there are no other people visible in the video. This could potentially pose a risk if the girl were to lose her balance or if there were any obstacles in her path. It is always recommended to skate in a safe environment with proper supervision, especially for young children."}]
