[{"pred": "no", "score": 2}, {"q": "how do men sprinkled water in the order", "a": "up and down", "pred": "In the video, a man is seen standing in front of a wooden fence and using a hose to sprinkle water on the fence. He then moves to the other side of the fence and continues to sprinkle water on the fence. He does this for a while, and then he moves to the back of the fence and sprinkles water on the fence again. He then moves to the front of the fence and sprinkles water on it once more. The video shows the man sprinkling water on the fence in a repetitive manner, but it is not clear if he is doing this for a specific purpose or just for fun."}]
