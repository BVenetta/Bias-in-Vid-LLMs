[{"pred": "yes", "score": 4}, {"q": "how dangerous is the activity of rope skipping", "a": "low", "pred": "The activity of rope skipping is generally considered safe when done correctly. However, there is a risk of injury if the rope is not handled properly or if the person skipping is not wearing appropriate safety gear. In the video, the girl is seen skipping on a rope while wearing a helmet, which is a good safety measure. However, it is important to ensure that the rope is of appropriate length and that the person skipping is not skipping too fast or too close to the ground to minimize the risk of injury. Additionally, it is essential to practice proper technique and to avoid skipping on hard surfaces or in crowded areas to prevent accidents."}]
