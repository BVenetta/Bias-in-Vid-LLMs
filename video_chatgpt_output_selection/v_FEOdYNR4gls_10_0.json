[{"pred": "yes", "score": 3}, {"q": "how safe is this activity of gymnastics", "a": "low", "pred": "The activity of gymnastics is generally considered safe when performed under proper guidance and supervision. However, there is always a risk of injury when performing any physical activity, especially when it involves complex movements and high levels of skill. In the video, the woman is seen performing a routine on a wooden floor, and while she appears to be skilled, there is a chance of falling or losing balance, which could lead to injuries. To minimize the risk, it is essential to wear appropriate safety gear such as a helmet, knee pads, and wrist guards, and to practice in a controlled environment like a gym or a designated gymnastics area. Additionally, it is important to warm up and stretch before engaging in any physical activity to reduce the risk of injury."}]
