[{"pred": "no", "score": 2}, {"q": "what is the risk factor for playing volleyball", "a": "lower", "pred": "The risk factor for playing volleyball on the beach is the possibility of injury due to the uneven surface of the sand. The sand can shift and move underfoot, making it difficult to maintain balance and control while running or jumping. Additionally, the sand can also get into players' eyes, ears, and mouth, causing discomfort and irritation. To minimize these risks, players should wear appropriate footwear with good traction and avoid playing in areas with deep sand or water."}]
