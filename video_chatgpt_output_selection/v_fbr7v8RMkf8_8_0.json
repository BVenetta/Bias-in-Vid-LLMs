[{"pred": "no", "score": 2}, {"q": "how dangerous is the activity of skiing", "a": "low grade", "pred": "Skiing is generally considered a safe and enjoyable winter sport. However, it is important to follow safety guidelines and take necessary precautions to minimize the risk of injury. In the video, we see people skiing on a snowy slope, and some of them are wearing helmets. Wearing a helmet is an essential safety measure, as it protects the head from potential impacts and reduces the risk of head injuries. Additionally, skiers should be aware of their surroundings, maintain control of their speed, and follow the rules and guidelines of the ski resort. It is also important to know one's skill level and avoid skiing on slopes that are beyond their capabilities. By following these safety measures, skiing can be a fun and enjoyable activity for everyone."}]
