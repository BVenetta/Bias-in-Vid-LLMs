This is a common tactic used by wrestlers to gain leverage, control, and momentum during a match. By applying pressure to the opponent's body, the wrestler can force the opponent to move in a specific direction or to relinquish control of the match. This can give the wrestler an opportunity to execute a submission hold or to gain an advantage in the match."}]
