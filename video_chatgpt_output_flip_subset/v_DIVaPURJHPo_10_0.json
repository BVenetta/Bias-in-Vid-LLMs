[{"pred": "yes", "score": 3}, {"q": "how dangerous is the activity of rope skipping", "a": "low", "pred": "The activity of rope skipping is generally considered safe when done correctly. However, it is essential to follow proper techniques and use appropriate equipment to minimize the risk of injury. In the video, the girl is seen skipping rope while holding the rope with her hands, which is a good technique to maintain balance and control. However, it is important to ensure that the rope is not too long, and the girl is not skipping too fast or too high, as this could lead to accidents or injuries. Additionally, it is crucial to wear appropriate footwear and avoid skipping on hard surfaces, which can cause strain on the joints and increase the risk of injury."}]
