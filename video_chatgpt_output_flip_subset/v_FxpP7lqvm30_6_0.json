The game involves throwing a frisbee back and forth between two players, and the other people in the group are watching and cheering them on. The children and adults are enjoying the game together, which fosters a sense of camaraderie and shared enjoyment. This type of activity can be a great way for families and friends to bond, have fun, and engage in physical activity. The beach setting also provides a relaxing and picturesque environment for people to spend time together and create lasting memories."}]
