[{"pred": "no", "score": 2}, {"q": "how dangerous is the activity of surfing", "a": "secondary", "pred": "Surfing can be dangerous, especially for beginners. The activity involves riding on a wave while standing on a surfboard, which requires balance, strength, and coordination. In the video, we see a man surfing on a wave, and he falls off the board. This shows that even experienced surfers can lose their balance and fall. Additionally, surfing can be dangerous due to the presence of strong currents, sharp rocks, and other surfers. It is essential to learn and practice surfing under the guidance of a professional instructor and to follow safety guidelines to minimize the risk of injury."}]
