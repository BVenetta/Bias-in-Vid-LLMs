This activity involves a certain level of risk, as there is a possibility of falling or getting injured. The white-haired people are wearing harnesses, which may help to reduce the risk of injury, but the overall risk factor remains high. It is essential to ensure that proper safety measures are in place and that the participants are well-trained and experienced in such activities to minimize the risk of accidents."}]
