[{"pred": "yes", "score": 4}, {"q": "how dangerous is the activity of skiing", "a": "low grade", "pred": "Skiing can be a dangerous activity, especially when done without proper safety equipment, training, or in unsuitable conditions. In the video, we see people skiing on a snowy mountain, and some of them are wearing helmets and goggles. However, it is important to note that not all skiers are wearing helmets, and some are skiing without any protective gear. This increases the risk of injury in case of a fall or collision. Additionally, skiing in unsuitable conditions, such as icy or uneven terrain, can lead to accidents and injuries. It is crucial for skiers to be aware of their surroundings, follow safety guidelines, and wear appropriate protective gear to minimize the risk of injury while skiing."}]
